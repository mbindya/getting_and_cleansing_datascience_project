## Week 3
## Course Project

### You should create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following. 

* Step 1: Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
* Step 2: Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
* Step 3: Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
* Step 4: Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
* Step 5: From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
